## 📖 Example Documentation Content

### Sample from HOW_IT_WORKS.md:
```markdown
## Time-Driven Simulation Loop

For each time unit t = 0 to 39:
    
    # PHASE 1: Task Release
    For each task in task_set:
        if t % task.period == 0:
            task.remainingTime = task.executionTime
    
    # PHASE 2: Task Selection
    selectedTask = scheduler.selectTask(ready_tasks)
    
    # PHASE 3: Execution
    if selectedTask exists:
        timeline[t] = selectedTask.id
```

### Sample from USER_GUIDE.md:
```markdown
**Step 1:** Enter first task
- Task ID: T1
- Execution Time: 2
- Period: 10
- Click [Add Task]
```

### Sample from QUICK_REFERENCE.md:
```markdown
| Algorithm | Max Util | Priority Type |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| RMS       | ~69%     | Static        |
| EDF       | 100%     | Dynamic       |
